## HTML/CSS LAB 1 PT.2

**Task:**
 Building off of your last lab, implement a media query to produce the following design.

*Build Specifications:*

● Write a media query using min-width syntax to change styles at 768px.    
● Flex properties are used to change the layout of the navigation from column to row.  
● A flex property is used to separate “chirpus inc” and the navigation items.    
● The lorem ipsum section takes up half the width of the page.  
● Use rgba(247, 136, 167, 0.6) for the largest circle.  
● Use rgba(247, 193, 162, 0.7) for the medium sized circle.  
● Use rgba(207, 130, 213, 0.6) for the smallest circle.  
● Use a combination of position, top, right, bottom, and/or left to position the circles on
the page. (you don’t have to use them all)  
● Circles have fixed widths and heights.  
● Circles should not be displayed in the mobile view.  
● Use a combination of position, top, right, bottom, and left to position the scroll down
button on the page. (you don’t have to use them all)
