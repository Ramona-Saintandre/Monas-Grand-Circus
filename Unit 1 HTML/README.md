**Building a Website**
____________________________

This is the first of two projects for Grand Circus after hours Front-End Boot Camp start October 14th, 2019. 

We need to create two folders. 
A HTML and a CSS folder. 

Then we are needing to create a [Git Repo](https://github.com/Ramona-Saintandre), and submit our projects via the repo.
