# Grand Circus Unit One PreCourse work 

This is the first assignment for the Grand Circus FrontEnd after hours bootcamp. 

I was tasked with two projects, both were very challenging.<br>   
The first project was to recreate a landing page with mobile first in mind.  
This has been a struggle for, and I am submitting it even the desktop part has not met the specification of the deliverable.  
This is due to the impending deadline.  

The second project was a javascript, which was not as hard as I thought it was going to be.  
I did have some scope issues, but once again because of the impending deadline.  
I decide to do the project using var instead of let.  

I did reach out to the Slack community, and used the wednsday tech service.  
Both were excellent resources, and I enjoyed meeting the people that are part of the Grand Circus community.
