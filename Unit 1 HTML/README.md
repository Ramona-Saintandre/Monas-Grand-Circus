# Grand Circus Unit One PreCourse work 

This is the first assignment for the Grand Circus FrontEnd after hours bootcamp. 

I was tasked with two projects, both were very challenging.<br>   
The first project was to recreate a landing page with mobile first in mind.  
This has been a struggle for, and I am submitting it even the desktop part has not met the specification of the deliverable.  
This is due to the impending deadline.  

The second project was a javascript, which was not as hard as I thought it was going to be.  
I did have some scope issues, but once again because of the impending deadline.  
I decide to do the project using var instead of let.  

I did reach out to the Slack community, and used the wednsday tech service.  
Both were excellent resources, and I enjoyed meeting the people that are part of the Grand Circus community.

Not sure why , but my media queries and mobile first was not working when I submitted. 

Thinking it would be a easy fix, I started making some changes and totaled the project.  
After 3 attempts, all files I have saved for learning purposes.  
(Maybe once I become better at this, I can get all 3 in working order.)  
I finally have a submittable project.  
It still has some issues, actually it has one issue.  
But I am to afraid to fix it, when I tried to comment out the logo element in the CSS, it throws everything back out of whack again.  
So my Adopt Me logo is not formatted right. 
I tried to use strong
