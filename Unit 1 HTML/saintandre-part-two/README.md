**What to Wear**
____________________________

This is the second of two projects for Grand Circus after hours Front-End Boot Camp that starts October 14th, 2019. 

We need to create two folders. 
A HTML and within that folder a script.js folder. 

Then we are needing to create a [Git Repo](https://github.com/Ramona-Saintandre), and submit our projects via the repo. 

**TASK**  
 write a script that will infrom the user what they should be wearing based on two conditions: the temperature and the event type. 
This information will be gathered through propmts.   
Use the following table to drive the logic of your program. 

**TABLE**

# Project Requirements


* [x ] The ***script.js*** file must be linked with the '\<body>'element of the index.html.  
* [x ] The ***script.js*** file will contain all of the code required to complete the challenge.  
* [x ] Declare and initialize the following three variables.
* **eventType** - will contain the information entered in the prompt for the event type.
* **tempFahr** will contain the information entered in the propt for the temperature in Fahrenheit.
* **result** is a string that will be logged to the console. 
* [x ] Use conditional statements to drive the decision making of your program.  See the example below.  
* [ x] Initializes **results** as a single string using concatenation. This string will contain the event type, temperature, and clothing suggestion.
* [ x] Logs the **result** variable to the console.  

**EXMAPLE:** 
“Since it is 33 degrees and you are going to a formal event, you should wear a suit
and coat.”
